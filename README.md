As part of our learning process in NUS Fintech Society, we embarked on a project to predict the Adjusted Close price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average using news headlines. The concepts we explored in this project include: Jaccard Similarity Coefficient, Sentiment Analysis and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
